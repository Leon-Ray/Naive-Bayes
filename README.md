sfCrimeClassify.py
==============

Purpose 
-------
A simple Naive Bayes classification of San Francisco crime categories using the [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data).

This script produces the actual predicated classifications rather than the probabilities of each class label, which is the Kaggle submission format.

The submission scored in the [top 3rd of all submissions and only 0.31437 error points from the top](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/leaderboard), which seems pretty good given the simplicity of the algorithm.
